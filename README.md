# repo-Team6
Team6 (Campbell, Donaldson, Dunn, Hansen)

This project is a voting system that my group and I developed over the course of the semester.  

We started out by using the Waterfall process, heavily documenting everything our program would do.  
After establishing this documentation, we built the project exactly as we had planned.  
Following our development, we made many changes and alterations, that we then planned to go back and revisit.  
We did not alter the software, as the goal of the Waterfall method was to show how time consuming it was,  
and how difficult it was to edit any mistakes.  
We then used the Agile Scrum method, where documentation was still extremely important, but there was a strong  
focus on team work and making changes throughout. We had scrum meetings where we would go through every  
portion of our project and make suggestions.  

During both processes, documentation was extremely important, as we wrote down every change and attribute that we  
developed. I believe that this is a skill I really strengtened while working on this project. Additionally, this  
was a project heavily focused on teamwork, which allowed me to build my leadership and collabortation skills.  
In the end, we produced a system that worked, and were proud of what we accomplished.  

Throughout the project we made a system design document to illustrate our whole process, which is in the SDD folder,   
labeled "SDD_Team6". This folder also contains a lot of other important information for our project, like diagrams and use cases.  
There is also important information in the SRS folder, mainly the "SRS_Team6" document, which goes over all requirements,  
and the folder also includes Use Case documents.  

The "Project 1" folder is from the first section, Waterfall, and "Project 2" is from the Agile Scrum portion.
